# Power-BI-Project-
I have done  Power BI Project of COVID-19 Dashboard on Power BI Desktop
Creating dashboard on Power BI is so exiting task. because during creating reports or dashboard we have consider every possibilities of every situation. during creating the dashboard i am thinking, i created the total cases or total deaths but i want to know which year more cases or deaths are happened then thought month also important then i had add the slicer of month also then which region was most affected by covid-19.
In dashboard, i am showing the cases and deaths by month and year wise. therefore we easily calculate the cases and deaths of particular month and year wise
we can easily findout sum of cases and deaths of overall or region wise. by map we can easily findout the Intence places
it is so exiting and amazing knowledge full task. using this dashboard we also calculate various reasons for COVID-19 Cases and Deaths. and we also eliminating that things
